			<h2>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra leak</h2>
			<p class="description">Images of what appears to be an S Pen stylus and carrying case for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S21 Ultra have leaked online, WinFuture reports. They show a stylus that looks similar in appearance to Samsung’s previous S Pens, as well as a phone case that’s a little wider than the handset itself to allow space for the optional accessory. WinFuture reports that the stylus will be sold separately from the phone for just under €40 (around $49).</p>
			<p>This phone case is necessary because the S21 Ultra is rumored to support the S Pen but reportedly won’t have a dedicated slot to store it unlike Samsung’s Note devices. The stylus is reportedly an optional accessory for the S21 Ultra, rather than something that comes in the box like with the Note phones.</p>
			<p>Rumors that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will work with the S Pen have been around for at least a month, and Samsung itself even hinted that support was on the way when its president of mobile TM Roh said the company would add some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” to other devices in its lineup. At the end of last month, an FCC filing all-but-confirmed that stylus support was on the way for the upcoming phone.</p>
			<p>According to WinFuture, the S21 Ultra will support many of the same S Pen features as previous Note devices. It will reportedly have a pressure-sensitive tip, gesture controls via an accelerometer, and controls for playing and pausing videos or remotely taking photos.</p>
			<p>Reports of stylus support coming to the S21 Ultra have coincided with rumors that Samsung was preparing to discontinue its Note lineup, which counts stylus support among its defining features. However, this has reportedly been disputed by one Samsung official.</p>
			<p>The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to be one of three devices that’ll make up the S21 lineup, alongside the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. Beyond its stylus support, other reports have claimed the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear camera array will include two telephoto cameras as well as a main 108-megapixel camera. Leaked video teasers suggest it’ll have a curved screen (compared to flat screens for the other two S21 handsets) and redesigned camera bump compared to the previous generation S20 Ultra, and WinFuture previously reported it’ll have a 6.8-inch 120Hz display, and a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging.</p>
			<p>Samsung has confirmed that its next Unpacked launch event will take place on January 14th, during which it’s expected to announce the new Galaxy S21 range and possibly a new Tile competitor alongside the heavily leaked Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds.</p>
